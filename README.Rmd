# About this package

This R package works in concert with an Access tool. Access table/column metadata can only be accessed via VBA, so the Access tool creates tables and queries with metadata that can be read through an ODBC connection. You can copy the necessary Access objects into your database from the template database in the `inst` folder of the GitHub repository for this package, or by running the following after installing the package:

```r
destination_folder <- "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents"  # Change this to wherever you want to save the template db
getTemplateDatabase(destination_folder)
```

The only R function in this package that you need is `fetchFromAccess()`. Given the path to your database, the prefixes that indicate export queries and lookup tables in your database, and an optional function that performs any custom data wrangling that you prefer to do on the R side instead of the Access query side, it will output a list of data and data dictionary tables. Optionally, it will also write these tables to csv (data) and tsv (data dictionary) files on disk. These files are formatted for compatibility with the IMD DRR Template EML generation tools.

For `fetchFromAccess()` to work, you must first complete the following steps to set up your Access database.

# Setting up your Access database

## Create data export queries in your protocol database

If you haven't done this already, the first step in the process is to create saved Access queries that wrangle your relational database tables into a flat format suitable for CSV export. In general, try not to summarize or perform calculations at this stage. Instead, aim to make each query more or less standalone by including site- and visit-level information like park, site, visit date, etc. You should also replace integer foreign keys to lookup tables with a meaningful short code as defined in the lookup table.

Name your queries with a consistent prefix - this is necessary for automated metadata generation. "qExport" is recommended but you may choose a different prefix if this conflicts with an existing naming scheme.

## Copy objects from Metadata Generation Template database

Download the Metadata Generation Template database from the `inst` folder of the GitHub repository for this package, or by running the following after installing the package:

```r
destination_folder <- "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents"  # Change this to wherever you want to save the template db
getTemplateDatabase(destination_folder)
```

There are six objects that must be copied from the template database to your protocol database:

  - tsys_Units (table)
  - frmMakeDataDict (form)
  - frmEditLookupInfo (form)
  - frmEditAttributeInfo (form)
  - AutoExec (macro)
  - mod_DocumentationTools (module)
  
Use **Ctrl + click** to select them all, then right click and select **Copy**. Open your protocol database, then right click anywhere in the navigation pane and select **Paste**.

You are now done with the template database, although it is a good idea to save it somewhere that you can find it in case any of the objects you copied are accidentally lost.

## Fill in some information manually

In the navigation pane of your protocol database, double click on **frmMakeDataDict**. The form should open to the **Start Here** tab. If not, navigate to it. Enter the prefixes of your data export queries and lookup tables. You can change the default values of these fields if you would like.

Click on **Create Metadata**. This will generate some metadata automatically, but for it to create an EML-compatible data dictionary, you will need to fill in some information manually. The good news is that you only need to do this once (but remember to update it if you make changes to your database).

You should see two other tabs called **Add Lookup Info** and **Add Column Info**.

### Adding lookup info

Ultimately, this table will allow codes and/or ID's in your exported data to be mapped to their definitions.

  1. Go to the **Add Lookup Info** tab in **frmMakeDataDict**. If everything has gone well up to this point, then the **lookupName** column should be populated with the names of the lookup tables in your database.
  2. It may be the case that some of these lookup tables aren't used in the export queries, or the codes are self-explanatory (e.g. "yes/no"). You can delete these rows or skip over them.
  3. There may be tables that you are using as lookups but aren't named accordingly (e.g. "tbl_Sites"). Add rows for these tables.
  4. For each lookup table in the **lookupName** column:
     - determine which column of the lookup contains the values that appear in the export query (usually a primary key or code). Enter the name of that column under **keyColumnName**.
     - determine which column of the lookup clearly defines the meaning of the code or ID. Enter the name of that column under **definitionColumnName**.
  5. You are done adding lookup table info! Just remember to update it if you modify, create, or delete a lookup table in the future.

### Adding attribute info

This table contains metadata on the columns of your exported data. EML refers to data columns as "attributes", so we'll use that term here. "Columns" will refer to the columns of the metadata tables you see in this Access tool. This metadata has been populated for you where it can be automated, but there is some information you will need to provide manually.

  1. Go to the **Add Attribute Info** tab in **frmMakeDataDict**. The first four columns (**tableName**, **attributeName**, **attributeDefinition**, and **class**) should be fully populated with information about each attribute in each export query. Do not modify or delete any of the data in these columns.
  2. Populate the **unit** column. Leave it blank for non-numeric attributes (text, Yes/No, and Date/Time). For all numeric attributes, including AutoNumber, you must enter a valid EML unit. Enter "dimensionless" for unitless quantities. See below for a full list of valid EML units (*use the value in the ID column*) [Note: download README.html to see the list; it does not render properly on GitHub]. 
      - If your unit is not present in the list below, enter it anyway. Make sure that it contains no spaces or special characters and that you enter it consistently each time. You will record this as a custom unit later, in the EML generation section of the Data Release Report.
  3. Populate the **missingValueCode** and **missingValueCodeExplanation** columns. You only need to fill these in for attributes that use codes instead of or in addition to blanks to indicate missing data (e.g. -999, "ND"). 
  4. Populate the **lookup** column for attributes whose values come from a lookup table. For all other attributes, leave it blank. The dropdown should show all of the lookup tables found in the **Add Lookup Info** tab. If you had to add or delete lookups, you may need to close **frmMakeDataDict** and reopen it before they will appear in the dropdown.
  5. (Optional at this stage) Populate the **dateTimeFormatString** column. Depending on what data wrangling you do in R, you may wish to populate this column in R instead.

You are all done in Access! Now you can use this R package to read your data and metadata into R.

```{r eml_units, echo=FALSE}
units <- EML::get_unitList()$units
units %>%
  dplyr::select(id, unitType, description, abbreviation) %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

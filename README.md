Access/R Data Dictionary Creator

# About this package

This R package works in concert with an Access tool. Access table/column
metadata can only be accessed via VBA, so the Access tool creates tables
and queries with metadata that can be read through an ODBC connection.
You can copy the necessary Access objects into your database from the
template database in the `inst` folder of the GitHub repository for this
package, or by running the following after installing the package:

``` r
destination_folder <- "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents"  # Change this to wherever you want to save the template db
getTemplateDatabase(destination_folder)
```

The only R function in this package that you need is
`fetchFromAccess()`. Given the path to your database, the prefixes that
indicate export queries and lookup tables in your database, and an
optional function that performs any custom data wrangling that you
prefer to do on the R side instead of the Access query side, it will
output a list of data and data dictionary tables. Optionally, it will
also write these tables to csv (data) and tsv (data dictionary) files on
disk. These files are formatted for compatibility with the IMD DRR
Template EML generation tools.

For `fetchFromAccess()` to work, you must first complete the following
steps to set up your Access database.

# Setting up your Access database

## Ensure relationships are up to date

This tool relies on table relationships being set up correctly. In your
Access database, go to **Database Tools** -\> **Relationships** and
verify that table relationships exist (*including lookup tables*) and
are correct.

## Create data export queries in your protocol database

prefix](instructionFigures/ExportQueries.PNG)

If you haven’t done this already, the first step in the process is to
create saved Access queries that wrangle your relational database tables
into a flat format suitable for CSV export. In general, try not to
summarize or perform calculations at this stage. Instead, aim to make
each query more or less standalone by including site- and visit-level
information like park, site, visit date, etc. You should also replace
integer foreign keys to lookup tables with a meaningful short code as
defined in the lookup table.

Name your queries with a consistent prefix - this is necessary for
automated metadata generation. “qExport” is recommended but you may
choose a different prefix if this conflicts with an existing naming
scheme.

## Copy objects from Metadata Generation Template database

Download the Metadata Generation Template database from the `inst`
folder of the GitHub repository for this package, or by running the
following after installing the package:

``` r
destination_folder <- "C:\\Users\\yourusername\\Documents"  # Change this to wherever you want to save the template db
getTemplateDatabase(destination_folder)
```

![Screenshot of objects to be copied from template to working
database](instructionFigures/CopyObjects.PNG)

There are four objects that must be copied from the template database to
your protocol database:

-   qsysMetadataAttributes (query)
-   frmMakeDataDict (form)
-   AutoExec (macro)
-   mod_DocumentationTools (module)

Use **Ctrl + click** to select them all, then right click and select
**Copy**. Open your protocol database, then right click anywhere in the
navigation pane and select **Paste**.

You are now done with the template database, although it is a good idea
to save it somewhere that you can find it in case any of the objects you
copied are accidentally lost.

## Fill in some information manually

In the navigation pane of your protocol database, double click on
**frmMakeDataDict**. In the form that opens, enter the prefixes of your
data export queries and lookup tables. You can change the default values
of these fields if you would like.

Click on **Create Metadata**. This will generate some metadata
automatically, but for it to create an EML-compatible data dictionary,
you will need to fill in some information manually. The good news is
that you only need to do this once (but remember to update it if you
make changes to your database).

You should see two tables that begin with “tsys_editMetadata”:
**tsys_editMetadataLookupDefs** and **tsys_editMetadataAttributeInfo**.

### Populating tsys_editMetadataLookupDefs

Ultimately, this table will allow codes and/or ID’s in your exported
data to be mapped to their definitions.

1.  Double click on **tsys_editMetadataLookupDefs** to open it. If
    everything has gone well up to this point, then the **lookupName**
    column should be populated with the names of the lookup tables in
    your database.
2.  It may be the case that some of these lookup tables aren’t
    referenced in the exported dataset, or the codes are
    self-explanatory (e.g. “yes/no”). Delete these rows from
    **tsys_editMetadataLookupDefs**.
3.  There may be tables that you are using as lookups but aren’t named
    accordingly (e.g. “tbl_Sites”). Add the names of these tables to the
    **lookupName** column.
4.  For each lookup table in the **lookupName** column, determine which
    column clearly defines the meaning of the code or ID. Enter the name
    of that column under **definitionColumnName**.
5.  Save and close **tsys_editMetadataLookupDefs**. You are now done
    with this table! Just remember to update it if you create or delete
    a lookup table in the future (or change the definition column name
    of an existing lookup).

### Populating tsys_editMetadataAttributeInfo

This table contains metadata on the columns of your exported data. This
metadata has been populated for you where it can be automated, but there
is some information you will need to provide manually.

1.  Open **tsys_editMetadataAttributeInfo**. The first four columns
    (**tableName**, **attributeName**, **readonlyDescription**, and
    **readonlyClass**) should be fully populated with information about
    each column in each export query. Do not modify or delete any of the
    data in these columns.
2.  Populate the **unit** column. Leave it blank for non-numeric fields
    (text, Yes/No, and Date/Time). For all numeric fields, including
    AutoNumber, you must enter a valid EML unit. Enter “dimensionless”
    for unitless quantities. See below for a full list of valid EML
    units (*use the value in the ID column*) \[Note: download
    README.html to see the list; it does not render properly on
    GitHub\].
    -   If your unit is not present in the list below, enter it anyway.
        Make sure that it contains no spaces or special characters and
        that you enter it consistently each time. You will record this
        as a custom unit later, in the EML generation section of the
        Data Release Report.
3.  Populate the **missingValueCode** and
    **missingValueCodeExplanation** columns. You only need to fill these
    in for columns that use codes instead of or in addition to blanks to
    indicate missing data (e.g. -999, “ND”).
4.  (Optional at this stage) Populate the **dateTimeFormatString**
    column. Depending on what data wrangling you do in R, you may wish
    to populate this column in R instead.
